Title:
Netlist Congestion Prediction with Graph Attention Network

Abstract:
In modern Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) chipdesign, congestion poses a significant challenge to the development process of semiconductor chip development. Currently, congestion is unknown until after placement and routing steps in the design process. This is inefficient and costly because if there is congestion, these long steps must be reiterated to improve the quality of the design. Predicting congestion early can expedite optimization efforts and enhance overall design efficiency. In this work, we explore the feasibility of leveraging deep learning techniques to predict local congestion prior to the routing stage. Using a digital integrated circuit (DigIC), we employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to predict the post-placement, pre-routing congestion levels in a netlist, in an attempt to preemptively address potential issues. Our analysis includes exploratory data analysis to understand key factors influencing congestion, pre-processing steps to prepare the data for implementation, and model training and testing using both GATs and a baseline extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. Our results indicate that our GAT model, particularly when incorporating engineered features, outperforms the XGBoost model in learning patterns in graph data. While the XGBoost model exhibits better accuracy in assigning demand values to chip regions, the GAT model provides insights into the underlying patterns of congestion. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning approaches for early congestion prediction in VLSI chip design.
